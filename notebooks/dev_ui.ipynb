Nevertheless, the\\nperformance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with\\nconvolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the\\nessence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for\\ntasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks,\\nas image classification does not align with either characteristic, we\\nhypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and\\nsegmentation tasks are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the\\nlong-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore\\nMamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we\\nconstruct a series of models named \\\\emph{MambaOut} through stacking Mamba\\nblocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results\\nstrongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all\\nvisual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is\\nindeed unnecessary for this task.

Similar to how humans\\nleverage whole-body and hand-eye coordination, we develop a mobile manipulator\\nthat exploits its ability to move and see, more specifically -- to move in\\norder to see and to see in order to move.

Our main\\ncontribution is quantifying the trade-off between the number of queries and the\\ncomplexity of the query language used by the learner.\\n  We measure the complexity of the region queries via the VC dimension of the\\nfamily of regions. We show that given any hypothesis class H with VC dimension\\nd, one can design a region query family Q with VC dimension O(d) such that for\\nevery set of n examples S \\\\subset X and every h^* \\\\in H, a learner can submit\\nO(d log n) queries from Q to a labeler and perfectly label S.

However, per-pixel\\ntime-to-contact requires object detection to serve its purpose effectively and\\nhence increases overall computational requirements as two different models need\\nto run. To address this issue, we propose per-object time-to-contact estimation\\nby extending object detection models to additionally predict the\\ntime-to-contact attribute for each object. We compare our proposed approach\\nwith existing time-to-contact methods and provide benchmarking results on\\nwell-known datasets.

The first is depth-aware masking that selectively masks certain parts\\nof non-occluded object queries in the feature space for simulating occluded\\nobject queries for network training. It masks non-occluded object queries by\\nbalancing the masked and preserved query portions adaptively according to the\\ndepth information.

Subsequently, for a\\nspecified customer type (i.e., the target task), inter-model knowledge transfer\\nis conducted to enhance its training accuracy. During this process, source task\\nselection is designed to choose the optimal subset of tasks (excluding the\\ntarget customer), and each selected source task uses a coefficient to determine\\nthe amount of DNN model knowledge (weights and biases) transferred to the aimed\\nprediction task. The proposed CM-DNN is tested on a real-world PV power\\ngeneration dataset and its superiority is demonstrated by comparing the\\nprediction performance on training the dataset with a single model without\\nclustering.',\n",

To this end,\\nwe present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model\\nfor 3D HPE, named \\\\textbf{FinePOSE}. It consists of three core blocks enhancing\\nthe reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt\\nlearning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling\\naccessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable\\nprompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication\\n(FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware\\nprompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp\\nStylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal\\ninformation related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each\\ndenoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation\\ndatasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further\\nextend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation. Achieving 34.3mm average MPJPE\\non the EgoHumans dataset demonstrates the potential of FinePOSE to deal with\\ncomplex multi-human scenarios.

In\\nrecent years, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method has emerged as a\\nstate-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, exploiting the shape of\\nsuch high-dimensional target distributions to efficiently generate samples.\\nDespite its impressive empirical success and increasing popularity, its\\nwide-scale adoption remains limited due to the high computational cost of\\ngradient calculation. Moreover, applying this method is impossible when the\\ngradient of the posterior cannot be computed (for example, with black-box\\nsimulators). To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage\\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a surrogate model. In this\\nmulti-fidelity algorithm, the acceptance probability is computed in the first\\nstage via a standard HMC proposal using an inexpensive differentiable surrogate\\nmodel, and if the proposal is accepted, the posterior is evaluated in the\\nsecond stage using the high-fidelity (HF) numerical solver. Splitting the\\nstandard HMC algorithm into these two stages allows for approximating the\\ngradient of the posterior efficiently, while producing accurate posterior\\nsamples by using HF numerical solvers in the second stage. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of this algorithm for a range of problems, including linear and\\nnonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with in-silico data and experimental data.\\nThe proposed algorithm is shown to seamlessly integrate with various\\nlow-fidelity and HF models, priors, and datasets.

       "  'summary': \"Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to acquire knowledge from\\nnovel classes with limited samples while retaining information about base\\nclasses. Existing methods address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting by\\nfreezing the feature extractor during novel-class learning. However, these\\nmethods usually tend to cause the confusion between base and novel classes,\\ni.e., classifying novel-class samples into base classes. In this paper, we\\ndelve into this phenomenon to study its cause and solution. We first interpret\\nthe confusion as the collision between the novel-class and the base-class\\nregion in the feature space. Then, we find the collision is caused by the\\nlabel-irrelevant redundancies within the base-class feature and pixel space.\\nThrough qualitative and quantitative experiments, we identify this redundancy\\nas the shortcut in the base-class training, which can be decoupled to alleviate\\nthe collision. Based on this analysis, to alleviate the collision between base\\nand novel classes, we propose a method for FSCIL named Redundancy Decoupling\\nand Integration (RDI). RDI first decouples redundancies from base-class space\\nto shrink the intra-base-class feature space. Then, it integrates the\\nredundancies as a dummy class to enlarge the inter-base-class feature space.\\nThis process effectively compresses the base-class feature space, creating\\nbuffer space for novel classes and alleviating the model's confusion between\\nthe base and novel classes. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets,\\nincluding CIFAR-100, miniImageNet, and CUB-200-2011 demonstrate that our method\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.\",\n",

       "  'summary': 'Change Detection (CD) aims to identify pixels with semantic changes between\\nimages. However, annotating massive numbers of pixel-level images is\\nlabor-intensive and costly, especially for multi-temporal images, which require\\npixel-wise comparisons by human experts. Considering the excellent performance\\nof visual language models (VLMs) for zero-shot, open-vocabulary, etc. with\\nprompt-based reasoning, it is promising to utilize VLMs to make better CD under\\nlimited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a VLM guidance-based\\nsemi-supervised CD method, namely DiffMatch. The insight of DiffMatch is to\\nsynthesize free change labels using VLMs to provide additional supervision\\nsignals for unlabeled data. However, almost all current VLMs are designed for\\nsingle-temporal images and cannot be directly applied to bi- or multi-temporal\\nimages. Motivated by this, we first propose a VLM-based mixed change event\\ngeneration (CEG) strategy to yield pseudo labels for unlabeled CD data. Since\\nthe additional supervised signals provided by these VLM-driven pseudo labels\\nmay conflict with the pseudo labels from the consistency regularization\\nparadigm (e.g. FixMatch), we propose the dual projection head for de-entangling\\ndifferent signal sources. Further, we explicitly decouple the bi-temporal\\nimages semantic representation through two auxiliary segmentation decoders,\\nwhich are also guided by VLM. Finally, to make the model more adequately\\ncapture change representations, we introduce metric-aware supervision by\\nfeature-level contrastive loss in auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments\\nshow the advantage of DiffMatch. For instance, DiffMatch improves the FixMatch\\nbaseline by +5.3 IoU on WHU-CD and by +2.4 IoU on LEVIR-CD with 5% labels. In\\naddition, our CEG strategy, in an un-supervised manner, can achieve performance\\nfar superior to state-of-the-art un-supervised CD methods.',\n",

Most of these T2V models often produce\\nsingle-scene video clips that depict an entity performing a particular action\\n(e.g., `a red panda climbing a tree'). However, it is pertinent to generate\\nmulti-scene videos since they are ubiquitous in the real-world (e.g., `a red\\npanda climbing a tree' followed by `the red panda sleeps on the top of the\\ntree'). To generate multi-scene videos from the pretrained T2V model, we\\nintroduce Time-Aligned Captions (TALC) framework. Specifically, we enhance the\\ntext-conditioning mechanism in the T2V architecture to recognize the temporal\\nalignment between the video scenes and scene descriptions. For instance, we\\ncondition the visual features of the earlier and later scenes of the generated\\nvideo with the representations of the first scene description (e.g., `a red\\npanda climbing a tree') and second scene description (e.g., `the red panda\\nsleeps on the top of the tree'), respectively. As a result, we show that the\\nT2V model can generate multi-scene videos that adhere to the multi-scene text\\ndescriptions and be visually consistent (e.g., entity and background). Further,\\nwe finetune the pretrained T2V model with multi-scene video-text data using the\\nTALC framework.

In this paper, we theoretically\\nanalyze the reversal curse via the training dynamics of (stochastic) gradient\\ndescent for two auto-regressive models: (1) a bilinear model that can be viewed\\nas a simplification of a one-layer transformer; (2) one-layer transformers\\nusing the framework of Tian et al.

Our analysis reveals a core reason\\nwhy the reversal curse happens: the (effective) weights of both auto-regressive\\nmodels show asymmetry, i.e., the increase of weights from a token $A$ to token\\n$B$ during training does not necessarily cause the increase of the weights from\\n$B$ to $A$. Moreover, our analysis can be naturally applied to other logical\\nreasoning tasks such as chain-of-thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022b).

By\\nadjusting the weight in the convex combination, FedStale interpolates between\\nFedAvg, which only uses fresh updates, and FedVARP, which treats fresh and\\nstale updates equally. Our analysis of FedStale convergence yields the\\nfollowing novel findings: i) it integrates and extends previous FedAvg and\\nFedVARP analyses to heterogeneous client participation; ii) it underscores how\\nthe least participating client influences convergence error; iii) it provides\\npractical guidelines to best exploit stale updates, showing that their\\nusefulness diminishes as data heterogeneity decreases and participation\\nheterogeneity increases. Extensive experiments featuring diverse levels of\\nclient data and participation heterogeneity not only confirm these findings but\\nalso show that FedStale outperforms both FedAvg and FedVARP in many settings.',\n",

       "  'summary': 'Biomanufacturing innovation relies on an efficient design of experiments\\n(DoE) to optimize processes and product quality. Traditional DoE methods,\\nignoring the underlying bioprocessing mechanisms, often suffer from a lack of\\ninterpretability and sample efficiency. This limitation motivates us to create\\na new optimal learning approach that can guide a sequential DoEs for digital\\ntwin model calibration. In this study, we consider a multi-scale mechanistic\\nmodel for cell culture process, also known as Biological Systems-of-Systems\\n(Bio-SoS), as our digital twin. This model with modular design, composed of\\nsub-models, allows us to integrate data across various production processes. To\\ncalibrate the Bio-SoS digital twin, we evaluate the mean squared error of model\\nprediction and develop a computational approach to quantify the impact of\\nparameter estimation error of individual sub-models on the prediction accuracy\\nof digital twin, which can guide sample-efficient and interpretable DoEs.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by\\nsynthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediately\\nbenefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation\\nmethods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world\\ndecentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving\\nrequirements. To bridge the gap, we propose and study the novel problem of\\nfederated graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we\\nfirst propose a general framework for federated graph condensation, in which we\\ndecouple the typical gradient matching process for graph condensation into\\nclient-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching. In this\\nway, the burdensome computation cost in client-side is largely alleviated.\\nBesides, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the\\ncondensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the\\ncondensed graph during the federated training can be utilized to steal the\\ntraining data under the membership inference attacks (MIA). To tackle this\\nissue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the\\nfederated graph condensation, which only needs to extract partial node features\\nin one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated\\ntraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our\\nframework can consistently protect membership privacy during training.\\nMeanwhile, it also achieves comparable and even superior performance against\\nexisting centralized graph condensation and federated graph learning methods.\",\n",
